# Meetup Automation

This project will help the MTA to post meetup announcements more easily, and
also notify meetup attendees via email and/or text message before a meetup takes
place.

## Setting up dev environment

This assumes that [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) has already been installed in your
global environment.

```bash
pnpm i
```
